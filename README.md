## My Process

### Built With
- Semantic HTML5
- CSS Flexbox (for centering)
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I Learned

I learned how to use `flex-direction: column` to change the layout from a row to a vertical stack. This helped me position the footer correctly underneath the card. I also learned how to use `margin-top` to create the perfect amount of breathing room between the card and the attribution text.
